# Week 1–2: Setup + Python Basics

## Weekly Goal
Set up all tools and learning Python fundamentals including variables, data types, lists, dictionaries, loops, functions, and basic file handling. Prepare your environment for all future projects.

## Tasks / Step-by-Step Actions

### 1. Setup Tools & Environment
- [x] Install Python (latest stable version)  
- [x] Install VS Code (or preferred IDE)  
- [x] Install Git and create a GitHub account  
- [ ] Create a folder structure for Phase 1 projects locally  
- [ ] Test Python installation: run `print("Hello World")`

### 2. Python Basics: Variables & Data Types
- [ ] Learn about variable assignment in Python  
- [ ] Practice strings, integers, floats, and booleans  
- [ ] Experiment with type conversions (`int()`, `str()`, `float()`)  
- [ ] Mini-Exercise: create variables for a simple “construction project” (e.g., project_name, budget, duration_days)

### 3. Lists and Dictionaries
- [ ] Learn Python lists: indexing, slicing, adding/removing items  
- [ ] Learn Python dictionaries: key-value pairs, adding/updating keys, iterating  
- [ ] Mini-Exercise: create a dictionary of 5 “projects” with name, budget, and status

### 4. Loops
- [ ] Learn `for` loops and `while` loops  
- [ ] Practice iterating over lists and dictionaries  
- [ ] Mini-Exercise: loop through your projects dictionary and print all project names and budgets

### 5. Functions
- [ ] Learn function definition and calling (`def function_name():`)  
- [ ] Learn passing arguments and returning values  
- [ ] Mini-Exercise: write a function that calculates the total budget of all projects

### 6. Basic File Handling
- [ ] Learn reading/writing text files (`open()`, `read()`, `write()`)  
- [ ] Mini-Exercise: save your project dictionary to a `.txt` file  
- [ ] Mini-Exercise: read the file back into Python

## Deliverables
1. Python environment successfully installed and tested  
2. GitHub repository created for all Phase 1 projects  
3. Python scripts demonstrating:
   - Variables & data types
   - Lists and dictionaries
   - Loops
   - Functions
   - File handling
4. Mini-Exercise scripts saved in `W01-02_Basics/Code/` folder

## Notes / Reflection
- Document any challenges faced and solutions  
- Record confidence levels for each topic (1–5)  
- Flag weak areas in `Resources/Notes/WeakSpots.xlsx`
